# DEQUE

Hello, this is a class for a double ended queue.

It may seem like an unimpressive regular data structure to other programmers,
but I worked on this class/ADT solely from notes I took in class, no online or in-class help.
Thus I'm very proud of it.
The class was fully functional in the test-cases from my textbook.


I also included the node and iterator classes that were also used as this is a doubly linked structure.
